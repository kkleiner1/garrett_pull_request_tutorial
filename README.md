I'm not creative enough to write something meaningful here. Help :(


    Okay, let's try this again...There once was a monk who had no nose. Oh the smells he wished to smell, the airs he wished to breathe. So he asked his fellow monkling what flowers smell like. The monkling drew him a picture of his favorite dephadill and told his friend to imagine how it smelled. He thought for a moment, and said it smelled nice. The monkling asked how he knew. And his friend responded, with a smile: My friend would make sure my first smell was nice. his answer was returned with the grandest of grins.
